### AC-01: Access Control Policy and Procedures

CONTROL: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal, documented, access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, and compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access controls.

MAPPING: Cloud Foundry integrates with an organization's Identity Provider (IDP) which dictates further account management policies.
