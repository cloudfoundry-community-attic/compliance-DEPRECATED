### DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS:

It is recommended that Platform Operations staff (those with administrative privileges to OpsManager or BOSH) recertify on an annual basis through a 2-day hands-on workshop provided by a commercial Cloud Foundry Foundation partner.

It is recommended that Developers (those with CLI or API privileges to deploy applications or services within Cloud Foundry) certify through a comprehensive Cloud Native Applications class, covering 12factor principles and microservices architecture.
