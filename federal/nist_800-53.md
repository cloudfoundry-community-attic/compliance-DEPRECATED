# NIST 800-53

The US federal government has many different certification programs for IT systems. Many of those programs (including FISMA and FEDRAMP) rely on a set of standardized controls published by NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

This chapter provides mapping of the 800-53 controls to the Cloud Foundry software. This can support [the development of a System Security Plan as documented by NIST](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-18-Rev1/sp800-18-Rev1-final.pdf).
