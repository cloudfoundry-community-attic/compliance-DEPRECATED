# Cloud Foundry
## Certification and Accreditation

Cloud Foundry is the world's most popular open source structured platform. And many of those Cloud Foundry environments operate in regulated environments, including federal government agencies and financial institutions. In the spirit of the open community that manages the project, this book provides the materials needed to develop System Security Plans and other accreditation materials.

This book is developed in GitBook, and the latest version can be found at http://cloud-foundry-community.gitbooks.io/cloud-foundry-certification-and-accreditation/content/
