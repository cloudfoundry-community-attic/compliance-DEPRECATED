# CIS Benchmark

The [Center for Internet Security](http://www.cisecurity.org/) (CIS) publishes [security benchmark](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/) files that can be used to automate the continuous monitoring of IT systems. The [CIS Benchmark for Ubuntu](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/downloads/show-single/?file=ubuntu1404.100) can be applied to the BOSH-orchestrated VMs within Cloud Foundry using Nessus or another scanning tool.
