# CIS Benchmark

The [Center for Internet Security](http://www.cisecurity.org/) (CIS) publishes [security benchmark](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/) files that can be used to automate the continuous monitoring of IT systems. The CIS Benchmark for Ubuntu can be applied to the BOSH-orchestrated VMs within Cloud Foundry using Nessus or another scanning tool.
